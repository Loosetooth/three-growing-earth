## Ocean crust age

This repo shows the ocean crust age projected on a ball, which you can rotate around by clicking and dragging.
All the crustal image data comes from [this webpage](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/crustalimages.html)

You can check it out [here](https://loosetooth.github.io/three-growing-earth/).
Please note that the texture is quite large (~75MB) and will need to be loaded. The page will show a black screen until the texture is loaded. (Loading bar is not implemented yet :) )
### Run locally

You should now be able to access the page on this url in your browser: `localhost:4000`
